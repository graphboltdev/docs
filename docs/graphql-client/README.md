# GraphQL client

The GraphQL client allows you to execute queries, mutations, and subscriptions with ease. Think of it as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) specifically designed for AppSync.

GraphBolt explores your AWS accounts and finds all your existing AppSync APIs. Just select one from the drop-down menu, and start executing queries.

# Subscriptions

GraphBolt supports GraphQL subscriptions. For now, you will only see the last received payload in the response view. Keeping message history is on the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/graphboltdev/projects/1/views/1?filterQuery=subsc&pane=issue&itemId=11954314) for future improvements.
